# This is CS50Rust

### Introduction to the Rust programming language.

This course is inspired by the legendary course CS50 from Harvard University. The objective of this course is to provide a progressive introduction to Rust as a programming language through exercises of gradually increasing complexity.

Most exercises are implementations of CS50 exercises, solved using Rust instead of C. However, there are also bonus original exercises that showcase Rust's strengths and ecosystem, such as how Rust can be used in Python with PyO3, how we can use Rust to create desktop applications with Tauri, and how Rust can be used to create websites through WASM.

Introductory-level Computer Science and C knowledge is assumed before taking this course, ideally what you would learn from CS50 ;).

You can get started by going over to week 0.
